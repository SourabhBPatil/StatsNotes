# Introduction
	- What is a sampling distribution needed? #card
		- In inferential statistics, we want to use characteristics of the sample (i.e.
		  a **statistic**) to estimate the characteristics of the population (i.e. a **parameter**).
		- If we obtain a random sample and calculate a sample statistic from that sample,
		  the sample statistic is a random variable .
		- The population parameters, however, are fixed. If the statistic is a random
		  variable, can we find the distribution? The mean? The standard deviation?
		- It is used to estimate the population parameters
	- What is a sampling distribution? #card
		- •The sampling distribution of a statistic is a probability distribution based on a
		  large number of samples of size n from a
		  given population.
